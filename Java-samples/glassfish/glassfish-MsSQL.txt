
To setup a SQL Server Datasource in Glassfish, follow these steps:

Copy Microsoft's SQL Server JDBC driver (sqljdbc.jar) to /glassfish/domains/domain1/lib/ext directory. 
(or add sqljdbc.jar to war project)

Note: "domain1" is a default Glassfish domain. The  domain may be different for specific deployments. 
Open administrative console of the Glassfish server: http://localhost:4848 
(or whichever value used instead of localhost) 

Login to the admin interface (Default username is admin and default password is adminadmin). 
From the main tree (Common Tasks) expand Resources and go to JDBC > Connection Pools. 
Create a Connection pool: 

Name: Generally connection pool name is the name of the database 
Resource Type: javax.sql.DataSource 
Database Vendor: Microsoft SQL Sever 

Then enter the following data: 

General Configuration 
Datasource class name: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDataSource 
Transaction Isolation: read-uncommited (this is very important!)

Additional properties 
user 
password 
databaseName 
serverName 
instanceName. 

The default port for SQL Server is 1433, if the server uses another port, 
it must be added to the property portNumber. 
The newly created connection pool will appear on the list of Connection Pools. 
Select the pool and do a connection ping test.
